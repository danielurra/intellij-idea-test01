# Connecting a IntelliJ Idea Java project with GitHub
Each java IDE has its own way to interact with remote repositories like GitHub<br>
But when it comes to selecting a `VCS (Version Control System)` almost all of them will use **Git**<br>
## Use "Test" button to get the current version of Git installed on your computer

## Verify your GitHub profile has been successfully connected

## Readme file rendered
One nice thing I did notice is that IntelliJ Idea will show the render version of your Readme file, how cool is that?<br>
You can now edit your readme file locally and upload changes as always.<br>

## PSVM shortcut

As with any other IDE you'll rely a lot on shortcuts when writting your code, **psvm** is one commonly used<br>
Below screenshot show it in action:<br>

After pressing the `TAB` key you will see the code automatically written, this is the easy way to deal with code boiler plate.<br>

## SOUT shortcut
A common practice when writing code is to rely in the system console, either to ask/receive data from the user or to simply show results<br>
The most used command when interacting with the console is `system.out.println`, luckily we have a shortcut available to assist us:<br>

# Start typing **sou** to see the menu
As you can see in below screenshot, as soon as you start typing the word **sout** the IDE will show you a menu<br>
Select the correct option and hit `TAB`:<br>
